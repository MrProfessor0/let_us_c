# let_us_c
This repository contains my solution on the let_us_c book.
This solution was when I was learning programming so there is a lot of scope for improving for me as well as you.

**IMPORTANT**
I didn't have a laptop when I solved these questions.
All solutions are solved on REDMI Note 7 Pro using  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.cxxdroid&hl=en&gl=US">Cxxdroid</a> app. So pointer and memory-related solutions are just a little bit different than the normal GCC compiler. 

If this repo is helping you. Don't forget to add **STAR**
